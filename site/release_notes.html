<h2>Release Notes for fish 2.1.1 (released September 26, 2014)</h2>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> if you are upgrading, stop all running instances of <code>fishd</code> as soon as possible after installing this release; it will be restarted automatically. On most systems, there will be no further action required. Note that some environments (where <code>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code> is set), such as Fedora 20, will require a restart of all running fish processes before universal variables work as intended.</p>

<p>Distributors are highly encouraged to call <code>killall fishd</code>, <code>pkill fishd</code> or similar in installation scripts, or to warn their users to do so.</p>

<h3>Security fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>The fish_config web interface now uses an authentication token to protect requests and only responds to requests from the local machine with this token, preventing a remote code execution attack. (closing CVE-2014-2914). <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1438" title="Restrict fish_config socket connections (CVE-2014-2914)">#1438</a> </li>
<li>
<code>psub</code> and <code>funced</code> are no longer vulnerable to attacks which allow local privilege escalation and data tampering (closing CVE-2014-2906 and CVE-2014-XXXX). <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1437" title="psub and funced don't protect tempfiles (CVE-2014-2906)">#1437</a> </li>
<li>
<code>fishd</code> uses a secure path for its socket, preventing a local privilege escalation attack (closing CVE-2014-2905). <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1436" title="/tmp/fishd.socket.user permissions checking (CVE-2014-2905)">#1436</a> </li>
<li>
<code>__fish_print_packages</code> is no longer vulnerable to attacks which would allow local privilege escalation and data tampering (closing CVE-2014-3219). <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1440" title="symlink attack in __fish_print_packages and spawning fishd (CVE-2014-3219)">#1440</a>
</li>
</ul><h3>Other fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<code>fishd</code> now ignores SIGPIPE, fixing crashes using tools like GNU Parallel and which occurred more often as a result of the other <code>fishd</code> changes. <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1084" title="Compatibility with GNU Parallel">#1084</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1690" title="Fishd exits on startup">#1690</a> </li>

<h2>Release Notes for fish 2.1.0 (released October 28, 2013)</h2>
<h3>Significant Changes</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Tab completions will fuzzy-match files.</b> <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/568">#568</a>

<p>When tab-completing a file, fish will first attempt prefix matches (<tt>foo</tt> matches <tt>foobar</tt>), then substring matches (<tt>ooba</tt> matches <tt>foobar</tt>), and lastly subsequence matches (<tt>fbr</tt> matches <tt>foobar</tt>). For example, in a directory with files foo1.txt, foo2.txt, foo3.txt&hellip;, you can type only the numeric part and hit tab to fill in the rest.

<p>This feature is implemented for files and executables. It is not yet implemented for options (like <tt>--foobar</tt>), and not yet implemented across path components (like <tt>/u/l/b</tt> to match <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>).

</li>

<li><b>Redirections now work better across pipelines.</b> <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/110">#110</a>, <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/877">#877</a>

<p>In particular, you can pipe stderr and stdout together, for example, with <tt>cmd ^&1 | tee log.txt</tt>, or the more familiar <tt>cmd 2>&1 | tee log.txt</tt></b></p>
</li>

<li><b>A single <tt>%</tt> now expands to the last job backgrounded.</b> <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1008">#1008</a>

<p>
Previously, a single <tt>%</tt> would pid-expand to either all backgrounded jobs, or all jobs owned by your user. Now it expands to the last job backgrounded. If no job is in the background, it will fail to expand. In particular, <tt>fg %</tt> can be used to put the most recent background job in the foreground.
</p>
</li>


</ul>

<h3>Other Notable Fixes</h3>

<ul>

<li>alt-U and alt+C now uppercase and capitalize words, respectively. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/995">#995</a></li>

<li>VTE based terminals should now know the working directory. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/906">#906</a></li>

<li>The autotools build now works on Mavericks. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/968">#968</a></li>

<li>The end-of-line binding (ctrl+E) now accepts autosuggestions. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/932">#932</a></li>

<li>Directories in <tt>/etc/paths</tt> (used on OS X) are now prepended instead of appended, similar to other shells. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/927">#927</a></li>

<li>Option-right-arrow (used for partial autosuggestion completion) now works on iTerm2. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/920">#920</a></li>

<li>Tab completions now work properly within nested subcommands. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/913">#913</a></li>

<li><tt>printf</tt> supports \e, the escape character. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/910">#910</a></li>

<li><tt>fish_config history</tt> no longer shows duplicate items. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/900">#900</a></li>

<li><tt>$fish_user_paths</tt> is now prepended to <tt>$PATH</tt> instead of appended. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/888">#888</a></li>

<li>Jobs complete when all processes complete. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/876">#876</a>
<p>For example, in previous versions of fish, '<tt>sleep 10 | echo Done</tt>' returns control immediately, because <tt>echo</tt> does not read from stdin. Now it does not complete until <tt>sleep</tt> exits (presumably after 10 seconds).</p>
</li>

<li>Better error reporting for square brackets. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/875">#875</a></li>
	
<li>fish no longer tries to add <tt>/bin</tt> to <tt>$PATH</tt> unless PATH is totally empty. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/852">#852</a></li>
		
<li>History token substitution (alt-up) now works correctly inside subshells. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/833">#833</a></li>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_flow_control">Flow control</a> is now disabled, freeing up ctrl-S and ctrl-Q for other uses. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/814">#814</a></li>

<li>sh-style variable setting like <tt>foo=bar</tt> now produces better error messages. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/809">#809</a></li>

<li>Commands with wildcards no longer produce autosuggestions. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/785">#785</a></li>

<li><tt>funced</tt> no longer freaks out when supplied with no arguments. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/780">#780</a></li>

<li><tt>fish.app</tt> now works correctly in a directory containing spaces. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/774">#774</a></li>

<li>Tab completion cycling no longer occasionally fails to repaint. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/765">#765</a></li>

<li>Comments now work in eval'd strings. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/684">#684</a></li>

<li>History search (up-arrow) now shows the item matching the autosuggestion, if that autosuggestion was truncated. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/650">#650</a></li>

<li>Ctrl-T now transposes characters, as in other shells. <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/128">#128</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Release Notes for fish 2.0.0 (released May 17, 2013)</h2>

<h3>Significant Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Command substitutions now modify <tt>$status</tt></b> <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/547">#547</a>.
<p>
Previously the exit status of command substitutions (like <tt>(pwd)</tt>) was ignored; however now it modifies $status. Furthermore, the <tt>set</tt> command now only sets $status on failure; it is untouched on success. This allows for the following pattern:
<pre>
if set python_path (which python)
   ...
end
</pre>

Because set does not modify $status on success, the if branch effectively tests whether <tt>which</tt> succeeded, and if so, whether the <tt>set</tt> also succeeded.

</p></li>

<li><b>Improvements to $PATH handling</b>.
<p>
<ul><li>There is a new variable, <tt>$fish_user_paths</tt>, which can be set universally, and whose contents are appended to $PATH <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/527">#527</a></li>
<li>/etc/paths and /etc/paths.d are now respected on OS X</li>
<li>fish no longer modifies $PATH to find its own binaries</li>
</ul></li>
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Long lines no longer use ellipsis for line breaks</b>, and copy and paste should no longer include a newline even if the line was broken <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/300">#300</a></li>

<li><b>New syntax for index ranges</b> (sometimes known as "slices") <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/212">#212</a></li>

<li><b>fish now supports an <tt>else if</tt> statement</b> <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/134">#134</a></li>

<li><b>Process and pid completion now works on OS X</b> <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/129">#129</a></li>

<li><b>fish is now relocatable</b>, and no longer depends on compiled-in paths <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/125">#125</a></li>

<li><b>fish now supports a right prompt (RPROMPT)</b> through the <tt>fish_right_prompt</tt> function <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/80">#80</a></li>

<li><b>fish now uses posix_spawn instead of fork when possible</b>, which is much faster on BSD and OS X <a class="issue_link" href="http://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11">#11</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Release Notes for <i>fishfish</i> Beta r2</h2>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Implicit cd</b> is back, for paths that start with one or two dots, a slash, or a tilde.</li>
<li><b>Overrides of default functions should be fixed</b>. The "internalized scripts" feature is disabled for now.</li>
<li><b>Disabled delayed suspend</b>. This is a strange job-control feature of BSD systems, including OS X. Disabling it frees up Control Y for other purposes; in particular, for yank, which now works on OS X.</li>
<li><b>fish_indent is fixed</b>. In particular, the <span class="mono">funced</span> and <span class="mono">funcsave</span> functions work again.
<li>A SIGTERM now ends the whole execution stack again (<a href="https://github.com/ridiculousfish/fishfish/issues/13">resolving this issue</a>).
<li>Bumped the __fish_config_interactive version number so the default fish_color_autosuggestion kicks in.
<li>fish_config better handles combined term256 and classic colors like "555 yellow".

</ul>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>A <b>history builtin</b>, and associated interactive function that enables deleting history items. Example usage:
	
<ul>
<li>Print all history items beginning with echo: <span class="mono">history --prefix echo</span></li>
<li>Print all history items containing foo: <span class="mono">history --contains foo</span></li>
<li>Interactively delete some items containing foo: <span class="mono">history --delete --contains foo</span></li>
</ul><br>

<h2>Release Notes for <i>fishfish</i> Beta r1</h2>

<h3>Scripting</h3>
<ul>
	<li>No changes! All existing fish scripts, config files, completions, etc. from trunk should continue to work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>

<li><b>Autosuggestions</b>. Think URL fields in browsers. When you type a command, fish will suggest the rest of the command after the cursor, in a muted gray when possible. You can accept the suggestion with the right arrow key or Ctrl-F. Suggestions come from command history, completions, and some custom code for cd; there's a lot of potential for improvement here. The suggestions are computed on a background pthread, so they never slow down your typing.

The autosuggestion feature is incredible. I miss it dearly every time I use anything else.</li>

<li><b>term256 support</b> where available, specifically modern xterms and OS X Lion. You can specify colors the old way ('set_color cyan') or by specifying RGB hex values ('set_color FF3333'); fish will pick the closest supported color. Some xterms do not advertise term256 support either in the $TERM or terminfo max_colors field, but nevertheless support it. For that reason, fish will default into using it on any xterm (but it can be disabled with an environment variable).</li>

<li><b>Web-based configuration</b> page. There is a new function 'fish_config'. This spins up a simple Python web server and opens a browser window to it. From this web page, you can set your shell colors and view your functions, variables, and history; all changes apply immediately to all running shells. Eventually all configuration ought to be supported via this mechanism (but in addition to, not instead of, command line mechanisms).</li>

<li><b>Man page completions</b>. There is a new function 'fish_update_completions'. This function reads all the man1 files from your manpath, removes the roff formatting, parses them to find the commands and options, and outputs fish completions into ~/.config/fish/completions. It won't overwrite existing completion files (except ones that it generated itself).</li>

</ul>

<h3>Programmatic Changes</h3>

<ul>

<li>fish is now entirely in C++. I have no particular love for C++, but it provides a ready memory-model to replace halloc. We've made an effort to keep it to a sane and portable subset (no C++11, no boost, no going crazy with templates or smart pointers), but we do use the STL and a little tr1.</li>

<li>halloc is entirely gone, replaced by normal C++ ownership semantics. If you don't know what halloc is, well, now you have two reasons to be happy.</li>

<li>All the crufty C data structures are entirely gone. array_list_t, priority_queue_t, hash_table_t, string_buffer_t have been removed and replaced by STL equivalents like std::vector, std::map, and std::wstring. A lot of the string handling now uses std::wstring instead of wchar_t *</li>

<li>fish now spawns pthreads for tasks like syntax highlighting that require blocking I/O.</li>

<li>History has been completely rewritten. History files now use an extensible YAML-style syntax. History "merging" (multiple shells writing to the same history file) now works better. There is now a maximum history length of about 250k items (256 * 1024).</li>

<li>The parser has been "instanced," so you can now create more than one.</li>

<li>Total #LoC has shrunk slightly even with the new features.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<ul>

<li>fish now runs syntax highlighting in a background thread, so typing commands is always responsive even on slow filesystems.</li>

<li>echo, test, and pwd are now builtins, which eliminates many forks.</li>

<li>The files in share/functions and share/completions now get 'internalized' into C strings that get compiled in with fish. This substantially reduces the number of files touched at startup. A consequence is that you cannot change these functions without recompiling, but often other functions depend on these "standard" functions, so changing them is perhaps not a good idea anyways.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some system call counts for launching and then exiting fish with the default configuration, on OS X. The first column is fish trunk, the next column is with our changes, and the last column is bash for comparison. This data was collected via dtrace.

<pre>
           before   after    bash    
  open          9       4       5
  fork         28      14       0
  stat        131      85      11
 lstat        670       0       0
  read        332      80       4
 write        172     149       0
</pre>

<p>The large number of forks relative to bash are due to fish's insanely expensive default prompt, which is unchanged in my version. If we switch to a prompt comparable to bash's (lame) default, the forks drop to 16 with trunk, 4 after our changes.

<p>The large reduction in lstat() numbers is due to fish no longer needing to call ttyname() on OS X.

<p>We've got some work to do to be as lean as bash, but we're on the right track.
